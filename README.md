## My name is Szymon Bujowski. Get to know me!

I'm currently studying Artificial Intelligence at Pozna≈Ñ University of Technology, Poland (Bachelor degree). I expect to graduate on February 2024.

Together with ![Preetam Sharma](https://github.com/white07S) we are working on a financial project related to trading.

## The tools I use(d):

Unless there is a ***specialized/designated tool*** for the type of task I'm working on, I'd use **Python** when I need it done, and **C++** when I need it to actually be fast.
