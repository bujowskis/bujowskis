## I'm here for you
This motto is the essence of what I, my life, my goals, and virtually anything I do is all about.

From my analysis and what people tell me, I'm a textbook case of an `Otherish Giver`. Read [Give and Take by Adam Grant](https://adamgrant.net/book/give-and-take/). Understand the concepts, understand me and my actions.

I lead with mind and logic, although I don't consider emotions useless and irrelevant. Emotions help us understand each other and ourselves and play a crucial role in our lives. Though, it's up to our mind to analyze and decide how to handle that information.

On top of that, I'm transparent, open and honest. I strongly believe the world would be much better if we were clear about our needs, intentions, etc. I will share it and tell you things, as long as it's not *truly* sensitive information. I am active on
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bujowskis/) - which I am using as a personal blog to update you on my life, my work, and keep my promise about being open and transparent
- [GitHub](https://github.com/bujowskis) - which I am using not only for programming, but also progress and organization - GitHub is not *"just a tool"*, ***GitHub is a lifestyle***

## My life's purpose
On November 6th, 2022, after over 21 years of my life, I finally figured out my life's purpose:
- **Family and Friends** - improve and bring value in their life
- **Creating value, improving *everyone's* lives** - as individuals and as a collective
- **Health and Happiness** *(although they are largely a byproduct of pursuing the above)*

I am driven to do, and strive doing whatever it takes to pursue these *(abstract)* goals by taking concrete actions.

On a funny note, to be precise, it's `255` months. A perfectly round number.

## Projects, Interests
As a result of my drive and life purpose, my interests are very varied. The main idea is using the acquired knowledge and skills to pursue them, make the world and people's lives a little better, one step at a time. It results in multiple projects of varying background, spanning different domains. Follow me to get the updates on what's currently in the making!
